### Processing Flight Delay CSV Files (2000–2004)

This code cleans and prepares flight delay data files for further analysis:

- Generates file names: `2000.csv`, `2001.csv`, ..., `2004.csv`
- Defines the required columns to keep
- Loops through each CSV file:
  - Tries reading with **UTF-8** encoding  
  - If it fails, retries with **Latin-1** encoding
- If all required columns are present:
  - Keeps only the specified columns  
  - Removes rows with missing values  
  - Saves the cleaned data as `<year>_Q2AB.csv`
- If required columns are missing, it prints a warning

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Initialize an empty list to store data frames
data_list <- list()

# Loop through each year
for (year in years) {
  file_name <- paste0(year, "_Q2AB.csv")
  
  # Check if file exists
  if (file.exists(file_name)) {
    cat("Loading", file_name, "...\n")
    data_list[[as.character(year)]] <- read_csv(file_name)
  } else {
    cat("File", file_name, "not found!\n")
  }
}

# Combine all data frames into one
if (length(data_list) > 0) {
  combined_data <- bind_rows(data_list)
  cat("All files successfully loaded and combined!\n")
  
  # Save combined data
  write_csv(combined_data, "Combined_Flight_Data_2000_2004.csv")
  cat("Combined data saved as 'Combined_Flight_Data_2000_2004.csv'\n")
} else {
  cat("No files found.\n")
}
```
###  Load Combined Flight Data

This step reads the merged CSV file `Combined_Flight_Data_2000_2004.csv` into a pandas DataFrame named `df`.  
This dataset includes cleaned flight records from the years **2000 to 2004**, prepared in the previous steps.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df <- read_csv("Combined_Flight_Data_2000_2004.csv")
print(df)
```
### 🧼 Cleaning and Formatting Flight Data

This section prepares flight data for analysis by selecting key variables and formatting values:

- Selects relevant columns: `Year`, `CRSDepTime`, `DepDelay`, `ArrDelay`, `DayOfWeek`, and `TailNum`
- Removes duplicate rows
- Converts `DayOfWeek` from numbers (1–7) to weekday names (Monday–Sunday)
- Formats `CRSDepTime` from integers like `700` to `"07:00"` using time parsing
- Prints the number of duplicates detected (should be 0 after removal)
- Displays the first few rows of the cleaned dataset

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_Q2a <- df %>%
  select(Year, CRSDepTime, DepDelay, ArrDelay, DayOfWeek, TailNum)

# Remove duplicates
df_Q2a <- df_Q2a %>% distinct()

# Map day numbers to names
day_mapping <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
df_Q2a$DayOfWeek <- factor(df_Q2a$DayOfWeek, levels = 1:7, labels = day_mapping)

# Format CRSDepTime (e.g., 700 → "07:00")
df_Q2a$CRSDepTime <- sprintf("%04d", as.integer(df_Q2a$CRSDepTime))
df_Q2a$CRSDepTime <- format(parse_time(df_Q2a$CRSDepTime, format = "%H%M"), "%H:%M")

# Count and print number of duplicates 
num_duplicates <- sum(duplicated(df_Q2a))
cat("Number of duplicate rows:", num_duplicates, "\n")

# Show first 5 rows
print(df_Q2a)
```
### Preparing and Cleaning Flight Delay Data

This step creates a clean and enriched version of the flight dataset:

- Selects key columns: `Year`, `CRSDepTime`, `DepDelay`, `ArrDelay`, `DayOfWeek`, and `TailNum`
- Removes duplicate rows
- Converts `DayOfWeek` numbers (1–7) into weekday names (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday")
- Formats `CRSDepTime` into `"HH:MM"` time format
- Creates a new column `TotalDelay` by summing `DepDelay` and `ArrDelay`
- Filters out rows with negative `TotalDelay` values
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_Q2a <- df %>%
  select(Year, CRSDepTime, DepDelay, ArrDelay, DayOfWeek, TailNum) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(
    DayOfWeek = factor(DayOfWeek, levels = 1:7,
                       labels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")),
    CRSDepTime = sprintf("%04d", as.integer(CRSDepTime)),
    CRSDepTime = format(strptime(CRSDepTime, format = "%H%M"), "%H:%M"),
    TotalDelay = DepDelay + ArrDelay
  ) %>%
  filter(TotalDelay >= 0)

# Print the cleaned and updated dataframe
print(df_Q2a)
```
### Grouping Flights by Departure Time Intervals

This section groups flights based on their scheduled departure time:

- Parses `CRSDepTime` into proper time format (`HH:MM`)
- Converts departure time into total minutes since midnight
- Divides the 24-hour day into intervals of 179 minutes
- Assigns each flight to a `TimeGroup` based on its departure time
- Increases group numbering by 1 so it starts from 1 instead of 0
- Removes any rows with missing values after transformation

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Parse CRSDepTime properly (if not already parsed)
df_Q2a <- df_Q2a %>%
  mutate(
    CRSDepTime = parse_time(CRSDepTime, format = "%H:%M")
  )

# Define time interval
time_interval_minutes <- 179

# Convert time to minutes since midnight
df_Q2a <- df_Q2a %>%
  mutate(
    MinutesSinceMidnight = hour(CRSDepTime) * 60 + minute(CRSDepTime),
    TimeGroup = cut(
      MinutesSinceMidnight,
      breaks = seq(0, 1440, by = time_interval_minutes),
      labels = FALSE,
      include.lowest = TRUE
    ),
    TimeGroup = TimeGroup + 1  # Start group numbering from 1
  ) %>%
  drop_na()

# Print the final dataframe
print(df_Q2a)
```
### Creating Labeled 3-Hour Time Intervals

- Uses the `TimeGroup` number to calculate the start and end of each 3-hour interval
- Labels are formatted as `"HH00hrs–HH59hrs"` (e.g., `"0600hrs–0859hrs"`)
- Adds a new column called `TimeInterval` with these labels

This makes the time grouping easier to interpret in tables or plots.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Generate labeled 3-hour intervals
df_Q2a <- df_Q2a %>%
  mutate(
    TimeInterval = paste0(
      sprintf("%02d", (TimeGroup - 2) * 3), "00hrs-",
      sprintf("%02d", (TimeGroup - 2) * 3 + 2), "59hrs"
    )
  )

# Display first 50 rows
print(df_Q2a)
```
### Visualizing Average Delays by Time of Day and Day of Week

This section creates a heatmap to show when delays are most and least severe.

- Groups the data by `TimeInterval` and `DayOfWeek`
- Calculates the average `TotalDelay` for each combination
- Converts the summary data into:
  - **Wide format** for inspection
  - **Long format** for plotting with `ggplot2`

- Creates a **heatmap**:
  - Each tile shows the average delay for a specific time and day
  - Color scale: light blue (short delays) to dark red (long delays)
  - Delay values are also printed inside the tiles

- Identifies the **minimum and maximum delay** points:
  - Prints the exact day, time interval, and average delay for both

This helps pinpoint when delays are least and most likely to occur across the week.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create pivot data with mean TotalDelay for TimeInterval × DayOfWeek
pivot_data <- df_Q2a %>%
  group_by(TimeInterval, DayOfWeek) %>%
  summarise(AvgDelay = mean(TotalDelay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Convert to wide format for heatmap and also long format for ggplot
pivot_wide <- pivot_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = DayOfWeek, values_from = AvgDelay)

pivot_long <- melt(pivot_wide, id.vars = "TimeInterval", variable.name = "DayOfWeek", value.name = "AvgDelay")

# Heatmap using ggplot
ggplot(pivot_long, aes(x = DayOfWeek, y = TimeInterval, fill = AvgDelay)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(AvgDelay, 1)), size = 3, na.rm = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkred", na.value = "gray90") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Delay by Time of Day and Day of Week",
    x = "Day of the Week",
    y = "Time Interval",
    fill = "Avg Delay (min)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5))

# Find min and max delay values and their locations
min_row <- pivot_long[which.min(pivot_long$AvgDelay), ]
max_row <- pivot_long[which.max(pivot_long$AvgDelay), ]

# Print summary of extreme values
cat(glue::glue("
Least Delay:
  - Day: {min_row$DayOfWeek}
  - Time Interval: {min_row$TimeInterval}
  - Average Delay: {round(min_row$AvgDelay, 2)} minutes

Longest Delay:
  - Day: {max_row$DayOfWeek}
  - Time Interval: {max_row$TimeInterval}
  - Average Delay: {round(max_row$AvgDelay, 2)} minutes
"))
```
### Analyzing Average Delays by Day of the Week (2000–2004)

This section compares average flight delays across different days of the week for each year.

- Sets the correct order of days (Monday to Sunday) for plotting.
- Groups the data by `Year` and `DayOfWeek` and calculates the **average total delay**.
- Converts `DayOfWeek` to a factor to preserve day order in the plot.

#### Bar Plot:
- Creates a grouped bar chart showing **average delay per day of the week** across years.

#### Identifying Extremes:
- For each year:
  - Finds the **day with the least delay**
  - Finds the **day with the most delay**

This summary helps quickly identify which day of the week had the best and worst delay performance in each year.

```{r fig.width=14, fig.height=8}
# Define day order
day_order <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")

# Calculate average delay by Year and DayOfWeek
day_delay_by_year <- df_Q2a %>% group_by(Year, DayOfWeek) %>%
  summarise(TotalDelay = mean(TotalDelay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(DayOfWeek = factor(DayOfWeek, levels = day_order))

# Bar plot with annotations
ggplot(day_delay_by_year, aes(x = factor(Year), y = TotalDelay, fill = DayOfWeek)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = sprintf("%.0f min", TotalDelay)),
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
    vjust = -0.3,
    size = 3,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues", direction = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Delay by Day of the Week (2000–2004)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Total Delay (minutes)",
    fill = "Day of Week"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title.position = "top")) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1)))  # Add space for text

# Identify least and most delayed days per year
least_delay_days <- day_delay_by_year %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  slice_min(TotalDelay, with_ties = FALSE)

most_delay_days <- day_delay_by_year %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  slice_max(TotalDelay, with_ties = FALSE)

# Combine into summary table
delay_summary <- left_join(
  least_delay_days %>% rename(DayOfWeek_LeastDelay = DayOfWeek, TotalDelay_LeastDelay = TotalDelay),
  most_delay_days %>% rename(DayOfWeek_MostDelay = DayOfWeek, TotalDelay_MostDelay = TotalDelay),
  by = "Year"
) %>%
  mutate(
    TotalDelay_LeastDelay = paste0(round(TotalDelay_LeastDelay), " mins"),
    TotalDelay_MostDelay = paste0(round(TotalDelay_MostDelay), " mins"))

```
### 🕘 Analyzing Delays by Time Interval (2000–2004)

This section evaluates how average flight delays vary across different times of day for each year.

- **Step 1**: Groups the data by `Year` and `TimeInterval`, then calculates the **average total delay**.
- **Step 2**: Extracts the starting hour from `TimeInterval` to sort time groups in logical order.
- **Step 3**: Creates a **grouped bar plot**:
  - Shows average delay per time block for each year.
  - Adds delay values as labels on each bar.
  - Uses a purple color palette for clarity.

- **Step 4**: Identifies the **least and most delayed time intervals** for each year.
- **Step 5**: Combines the results into a summary table.
- **Step 6**: Displays the final table using `kable()` for a clean, formatted view.

This helps reveal which times of day were typically best or worst for on-time arrivals.

```{r fig.width=14, fig.height=8}
# Step 1: Calculate average delay by Year and TimeInterval
time_delay_by_year <- df_Q2a %>% group_by(Year, TimeInterval) %>%
  summarise(TotalDelay = mean(TotalDelay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Step 2: Extract numeric order from TimeInterval using base R
time_delay_by_year <- time_delay_by_year %>%
  mutate(
    TimeOrder = as.integer(sub("^(\\d+).*", "\\1", TimeInterval)),
    TimeInterval = fct_reorder(TimeInterval, TimeOrder)
  )

# Step 3: Plot bar chart with annotated labels
ggplot(time_delay_by_year, aes(x = factor(Year), y = TotalDelay, fill = TimeInterval)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = sprintf("%.0f min", TotalDelay)),
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
    vjust = -0.3,
    size = 2.8,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Purples") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Delay by Time Interval (2000–2004)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Total Delay (minutes)",
    fill = "Time Interval"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title.position = "top")) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1)))

# Step 4: Find least and most delayed time intervals per year
least_delay_times <- time_delay_by_year %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  slice_min(TotalDelay, with_ties = FALSE)

most_delay_times <- time_delay_by_year %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  slice_max(TotalDelay, with_ties = FALSE)

# Step 5: Combine into summary table
time_delay_summary <- left_join(
  least_delay_times %>% rename(TimeInterval_LeastDelay = TimeInterval, TotalDelay_LeastDelay = TotalDelay),
  most_delay_times %>% rename(TimeInterval_MostDelay = TimeInterval, TotalDelay_MostDelay = TotalDelay),
  by = "Year"
) %>%
  mutate(
    TotalDelay_LeastDelay = paste0(round(TotalDelay_LeastDelay), " mins"),
    TotalDelay_MostDelay = paste0(round(TotalDelay_MostDelay), " mins")
  )

# Step 6: Display the final summary table
kable(time_delay_summary, caption = "Least and Most Delayed Time Intervals per Year", align = "c")

```

### Question 2b

### Loading and Cleaning Aircraft Data

This section prepares aircraft information for merging with flight delay data:

- Loads the aircraft dataset from `"plane-data.csv"`.
- Selects relevant columns (`Year`, `TotalDelay`, `TailNum`) from the cleaned flight delay dataset `df_Q2a`.
- Filters the plane data to keep rows where `issue_date` is available and not `"None"`.
- Converts `issue_date` to proper date format.
- Calculates `YearOfCommission`:
  - If the aircraft was issued in December, the commission year is set to the following year.
- Renames `tailnum` to `TailNum` to match with the flight dataset.
- Keeps only the necessary columns for merging: `TailNum`, `issue_date`, and `YearOfCommission`.
This prepares both datasets for combining based on aircraft tail numbers.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

df_plane_Q2b <- df_plane %>%
  filter(!is.na(issue_date) & issue_date != "None") %>%
  mutate(
    issue_date = as.Date(issue_date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
    YearOfCommission = year(issue_date) + ifelse(month(issue_date) > 11, 1, 0),
    TailNum = tailnum
  ) %>%
  select(TailNum, issue_date, YearOfCommission)

# Step 1: Load plane data
df_plane <- read_csv("plane-data.csv")

# Step 2: Select relevant columns from df_Q2a
df_Q2b <- df_Q2a %>%
  select(Year, TotalDelay, TailNum)

# Step 3: Select and clean plane data
df_plane_Q2b <- df_plane %>%
  select(tailnum, issue_date) %>%
  filter(!is.na(issue_date))



# Step 4: Print data (first few rows for readability)
print(head(df_Q2b, 10))
print(head(df_plane_Q2b, 10))

```
### Final Cleaning of Aircraft Data

This step ensures the aircraft dataset is correctly formatted and ready for merging:

- Parses `issue_date` into proper `Date` format using `"MM/DD/YYYY"` style.
- Calculates `YearOfCommission`:
  - Adds 1 year if the aircraft was issued in December (to account for end-of-year delivery).
- Renames `tailnum` to `TailNum` if it exists, to match the naming convention in the flight data.

This prepares the aircraft data for accurate joining with flight delay records.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}



# Parse issue_date (assuming MM/DD/YYYY format)
df_plane_Q2b <- df_plane_Q2b %>%
 mutate(issue_date = as.Date(issue_date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))  

# Add YearOfCommission
df_plane_Q2b <- df_plane_Q2b %>%
 mutate(YearOfCommission = year(issue_date) + ifelse(month(issue_date) > 11, 1, 0))

# Rename if tailnum exists
if ("tailnum" %in% names(df_plane_Q2b)) {
  df_plane_Q2b <- df_plane_Q2b %>%
    rename(TailNum = tailnum)
}

# View output
print(head(df_plane_Q2b, 10))

    
```
### Merging Flight and Aircraft Data

This section combines flight delay data with aircraft commission data:

- Performs an **inner join** on `TailNum` to keep only records where both flight and aircraft information are available.
- Removes any duplicate rows that may result from the merge.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Inner join on TailNum
df_Q2b <- inner_join(df_Q2b, df_plane_Q2b, by = "TailNum")

# Drop duplicate rows
df_Q2b <- df_Q2b %>% distinct()

print(head(df_Q2b, 10))

```

### Calculating Aircraft Age at Time of Flight

- Calculates aircraft `Age` by subtracting `YearOfCommission` from the flight `Year`.
- Filters out rows where the result is negative.

This gives the age of each aircraft at the time of its flight.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Calculate Age
df_Q2b <- df_Q2b %>%
  mutate(Age = Year - YearOfCommission)

# Filter out negative ages
df_Q2b <- df_Q2b %>%
  filter(Age >= 0)

# View result
print(head(df_Q2b, 10))
```
### Categorizing Aircraft Age

- Creates a new column `Age_Category` to group aircraft into:
  - `"Young"`: less than 10 years old
  - `"Middle"`: between 10 and 19 years old
  - `"Old"`: 20 years or older

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Categorize Age into Young, Middle, Old
df_Q2b <- df_Q2b %>%
  mutate(
    Age_Category = case_when(
      Age < 10 ~ "Young",
      Age >= 10 & Age < 20 ~ "Middle",
      Age >= 20 ~ "Old"
    )
  )

# Reset row index 
df_Q2b <- df_Q2b %>%
  mutate(RowID = row_number()) %>%
  select(-RowID)  

print(head(df_Q2b, 10))
```
### Converting Decimal Delays to Minutes and Seconds

Defines a helper function `convert_to_minutes_seconds()` that:

- Takes a numeric delay value (in decimal minutes)
- Converts the whole number part to **minutes**
- Converts the fractional part to **seconds**
- Returns a formatted string like `"5m 30s"`
- Returns `NA` if the input is missing

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
convert_to_minutes_seconds <- function(delay) {
  if (is.na(delay)) {
    return(NA_character_)
  }
  minutes <- floor(delay)
  seconds <- round((delay - minutes) * 60)
  return(paste0(minutes, "m ", seconds, "s"))
}
```
### 📊 Average Delay by Aircraft Age Group Formating

- Sorts the dataset by `Year` and `Age_Category` for organized grouping.
- Calculates the **average `TotalDelay`** for each year and aircraft age group.
- Applies a formatting function to convert delay values into `"Xm Ys"` format (e.g., `"12m 30s"`).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Sort by Year and Age_Category
df_Q2b <- df_Q2b %>%
  arrange(Year, Age_Category)

# Group and calculate mean TotalDelay
df_Q2b_grouped <- df_Q2b %>%
  group_by(Year, Age_Category) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(TotalDelay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Apply formatting
df_Q2b_grouped <- df_Q2b_grouped %>%
  mutate(Mean_Formatted = sapply(Mean, convert_to_minutes_seconds))

# Print result
print(df_Q2b_grouped)
```
### 📊 Mean Delay by Aircraft Age Group 

This section visualizes and summarizes how average flight delays vary by aircraft age group for each year.

- Ensures `Age_Category` is properly ordered as: **Young → Middle → Old**
- Creates a **grouped bar plot**:
  - X-axis: `Year`
  - Y-axis: average delay (`Mean`)
  - Bars are grouped and colored by `Age_Category`
  - Delay values (in minutes) are shown above each bar for clarity
  - Uses a clean `theme_minimal()` layout with a blue-green color scale

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Ensure Age_Category is ordered
df_Q2b_grouped <- df_Q2b_grouped %>%
  mutate(
    Age_Category = factor(Age_Category, levels = c("Young", "Middle", "Old")),
    Mean_Formatted = sapply(Mean, convert_to_minutes_seconds)
  )

# Create grouped bar plot with labels
ggplot(df_Q2b_grouped, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Mean, fill = Age_Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = paste0(sprintf("%02d", floor(Mean)), "m")),
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
    vjust = -0.3,
    size = 3,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "GnBu", direction = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Annual Mean Delay by Age Category (2000–2004)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Mean Delay (minutes)",
    fill = "Age Category"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "right",
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1)))

# Step 4: Identify highest delay category per year
years <- 2000:2003
highest_mean_by_year <- list()

for (yr in years) {
  year_data <- df_Q2b_grouped %>% filter(Year == yr)
  if (nrow(year_data) > 0 && any(!is.na(year_data$Mean))) {
    max_row <- year_data[which.max(year_data$Mean), ]
    highest_mean_by_year[[as.character(yr)]] <- list(
      Category = max_row$Age_Category,
      Mean = max_row$Mean_Formatted
    )
  }
}

# Step 5: Print summary results
for (yr in names(highest_mean_by_year)) {
  info <- highest_mean_by_year[[yr]]
  cat(sprintf("Year %s: %s has the highest mean delay of %s\n",
              yr, info$Category, info$Mean))
}
```
### 2-way ANOVA: Effect of Year and Aircraft Age on Delay

This section uses a linear model to test whether **Year**, **Aircraft Age Category**, and their **interaction** have a statistically significant effect on average flight delays.

This helps determine whether changes in delay are significantly related to aircraft age, the year of operation, or both combined.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Fit linear model with interaction
model <- lm(Mean ~ Year + Age_Category + Year:Age_Category, data = df_Q2b_grouped)

# Perform Type II ANOVA
anova_table <- Anova(model, type = 2)  # from car package

print(anova_table)
```
### Deleting Cleaned CSV Files (2000–2004)

This chunk removes temporary or intermediate CSV files created during data processing.

- **Step 1**: Generates a list of file names: `2000_Q2AB.csv` to `2004_Q2AB.csv`
- **Step 2**: Prints the list of files that are about to be deleted
- **Step 3**: Prompts the user for confirmation before deletion
  - Accepts `'Y'` to proceed or `'N'` to cancel
  - Loops until valid input is provided
- **Step 4**: If confirmed, deletes each file and reports the outcome

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Generate list of file names
years <- 2000:2004
csv_files <- paste0(years, "_Q2AB.csv")

# Show list of files to delete
cat("Files to be deleted:\n")
print(csv_files)

# Prompt for user confirmation
confirmation <- tolower(readline(prompt = "Do you want to delete the above files? (Y/N): "))

while (confirmation != "y") {
  if (confirmation == "n") {
    cat("Deletion cancelled. Run the chunk again to retry. Thank you.\n")
    break
  } else {
    confirmation <- tolower(readline(prompt = "Invalid input. Please enter 'Y' or 'N': "))
  }
}

# Delete files if confirmed
if (confirmation == "y") {
  for (file in csv_files) {
    if (file.exists(file)) {
      file.remove(file)
      cat("Deleted:", file, "\n")
    } else {
      cat("File not found:", file, "\n")
    }
  }
  cat("Task completed! Cleaned files deleted.\n")
}
```
### Question 2C

### Cleaning and Saving Required Columns from Raw CSV Files (2000–2004)

This code processes raw flight data files by keeping only the necessary columns and removing rows with missing values.

- **Defines file names**: `"2000.csv"` to `"2004.csv"`
- **Lists required columns** for analysis (e.g., departure/arrival times, distance, carrier, etc.)
- **Loops through each file**:
  - Attempts to read using UTF-8 encoding; falls back to Latin-1 if needed
  - If all required columns are present:
    - Keeps only those columns
    - Removes rows with missing values
    - Saves the cleaned data to a new file with `_Q2C.csv` suffix
  - Otherwise, skips the file and prints a warning
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Define file names
years <- 2000:2004
csv_files <- paste0(years, ".csv")

# Define required columns
columns_needed <- c("Month", "DayofMonth", "DayOfWeek", "CRSDepTime", "CRSArrTime", 
                    "Distance", "UniqueCarrier", "Origin", "Dest", "TaxiOut", "Year", "Diverted")

# Loop through files
for (file in csv_files) {
  cat("Reading", file, "...\n")
  
  # Try UTF-8, fallback to Latin-1
  data <- tryCatch({
    read_csv(file, locale = locale(encoding = "UTF-8"))
  }, error = function(e) {
    cat("UTF-8 failed, trying Latin-1...\n")
    read_csv(file, locale = locale(encoding = "Latin1"))
  })
  
  # Keep only needed columns and remove NA
  if (all(columns_needed %in% colnames(data))) {
    updated_data <- data %>%
      select(all_of(columns_needed)) %>%
      drop_na()
    
    # Save to new CSV file
    output_file <- gsub(".csv", "_Q2C.csv", file)
    write_csv(updated_data, output_file)
    
    cat("Processed:", file, "→ Saved as", output_file, "\n")
  } else {
    cat("Warning:", file, "is missing some required columns. Skipping.\n")
  }
}
```

### Loading and Combining Cleaned Data (2000–2004)

This section loads all processed `_Q2C.csv` files and combines them into a single dataset for analysis.

- Defines `top_n_levels()`:
  - Keeps only the top `n` most frequent levels in a categorical variable
  - Groups all other levels into `"Other"`

- Loops through each year from 2000 to 2004:
  - Loads the corresponding cleaned CSV file (if it exists)
  - Appends the data to `combined_data`
  - Skips any missing files and prints a message

The result is a combined dataset across all five years, ready for modeling and exploration.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# function to group factor levels
top_n_levels <- function(vec, n = 20) {
  top_levels <- names(sort(table(vec), decreasing = TRUE))[1:n]
  factor(ifelse(vec %in% top_levels, vec, "Other"))
}
```
### 📂 Combining Cleaned Flight Data (2000–2004)

This step loads and merges yearly cleaned flight data files into one dataset:

- Loops through the years **2000 to 2004**
- Constructs each file name (e.g., `2000_Q2C.csv`)
- If the file exists:
  - Reads the CSV file using `read_csv()`
  - Appends its content to `combined_data`
- If the file does not exist, prints a warning message

The final result is a unified dataset, `combined_data`, containing flight records from all available years.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load and combine all processed _Q2C CSVs
years <- 2000:2004
combined_data <- data.frame()

for (year in years) {
  file <- paste0(year, "_Q2C.csv")
  if (file.exists(file)) {
    df <- read_csv(file, show_col_types = FALSE)
    combined_data <- bind_rows(combined_data, df)
  } else {
    cat("File not found:", file, "\n")
  }
}
```
### Preprocessing Combined Flight Data for Modeling

This step prepares the full dataset (`combined_data`) for modeling by filtering and formatting key variables:

- **Removes rows with missing values** in important columns:
  - Month, DayofMonth, Departure/Arrival times, Distance, Carrier, Origin, Destination, and Diverted status
- **Reduces category levels** using the `top_n_levels()` function:
  - Keeps the top 20 most frequent `Origin` and `Dest` airports
  - Keeps the top 10 most frequent `UniqueCarrier` values
  - All other values are grouped under `"Other"`
- **Converts key columns to factors**: `Month`, `DayofMonth`, `UniqueCarrier`, `Origin`, and `Dest`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Preprocessing
  Qn_2C <- combined_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(Month), !is.na(DayofMonth), !is.na(CRSDepTime), !is.na(CRSArrTime), 
         !is.na(Distance), !is.na(UniqueCarrier), !is.na(Origin), !is.na(Dest), !is.na(Diverted)) %>%
  mutate(
    Origin = top_n_levels(Origin, 20),
    Dest = top_n_levels(Dest, 20),
    UniqueCarrier = top_n_levels(UniqueCarrier, 10),
    Month = as.factor(Month),
    DayofMonth = as.factor(DayofMonth),
    UniqueCarrier = as.factor(UniqueCarrier),
    Origin = as.factor(Origin),
    Dest = as.factor(Dest)
  )
```

### Logistic Regression Modeling by Year (2000–2004)
This section fits a logistic regression model for each year to predict whether a flight was diverted, using selected flight features.

#### Model Setup
- Defines a formula to model `Diverted` using:
  - Month, DayofMonth, CRSDepTime, CRSArrTime, Distance, UniqueCarrier, Origin, and Dest
- Initializes storage to save:
  - Coefficients
  - AUC scores
  - Predicted probabilities and actual outcomes

#### Yearly Modeling Loop
For each year (2000–2004):
- Filters data for that year
- Splits into 80% training and 20% testing sets
- Fits a **logistic regression model** using `glm()` with a binomial family
- Extracts model coefficients:
  - Cleans and groups them by feature for summarization
  - Stores both grouped and ungrouped versions
- Predicts probabilities on the test set
- Calculates **AUC** (Area Under the ROC Curve) for model performance
- Prints:
  - Simplified average coefficients per feature
  - AUC score for that year


#### Final Model Evaluation
- After looping through all years:
  - Combines predictions across years
  - Calculates the **overall AUC score**
  - Prints the final performance summary

This process provides yearly and overall insight into which features influenced flight diversions, and how accurately the model performed.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Model formula
model_formula <- Diverted ~ Month + DayofMonth + CRSDepTime + CRSArrTime + Distance + UniqueCarrier + Origin + Dest

      term = gsub("[0-9]+$", "", term),                               # Remove trailing numbers
      feature = gsub("_[^_]+$", "", term)                             # Remove one-hot encoded levels
    )

    summarize(mean_coef = mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  coefficients[[as.character(year)]] <- summary_coef

  ungrouped_coefs[[as.character(year)]] <- tidy(model) %>%

} else {
  cat("\n⚠️ No data available for AUC calculation.\n")
}
```
### 📉 Plotting the ROC Curve for Diversion Prediction

This section visualizes the model’s performance across all years using an ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve.

- Creates an ROC object using the combined true labels (`all_y_true`) and predicted probabilities (`all_y_prob`)
- Extracts:
  - **False Positive Rate (FPR)** = 1 - Specificity
  - **True Positive Rate (TPR)** = Sensitivity
- Calculates the **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** value

#### 🖼️ Plot:
- Draws the ROC curve using `ggplot2`
- Adds a diagonal dashed line as a baseline (random guess)
- Displays the AUC value in the subtitle
- Uses a minimal theme for clean visual presentation

The ROC curve provides a visual assessment of how well the model distinguishes between diverted and non-diverted flights.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create ROC object
roc_obj <- roc(all_y_true, all_y_prob)

# Extract values for plotting
roc_df <- data.frame(
  FPR = 1 - roc_obj$specificities,
  TPR = roc_obj$sensitivities
)

auc_value <- auc(roc_obj)

# Plot using ggplot2
ggplot(roc_df, aes(x = FPR, y = TPR)) +

  ) +

### Top Logistic Regression Features for Year 2000

This section visualizes the most influential features from the 2000 logistic regression model.

- Uses the **ungrouped coefficients** from the model to identify specific predictors (e.g., `Dest_LAX`, `Origin_EWR`)
- Extracts:
  - The **top 8 destination-related features** (starting with `"Dest"`) by absolute coefficient value
  - The **top 10 most impactful features overall**, excluding destinations
- Combines both sets, removes duplicates, and sorts by coefficient value

####️ Plot:
- Bar chart shows each feature's **coefficient**, which indicates:
  - **Positive values**: feature increases the likelihood of a flight being diverted
  - **Negative values**: feature decreases that likelihood

This chart highlights which destination airports and other features had the strongest influence on flight diversion predictions in 2000.The same set of codes are excuted for the other 4 years from 2001 to 2004

### Comparing Feature Importance Across Years (2000–2004)

This plot shows how the **average logistic regression coefficient** for each feature changes over time.

- Combines yearly coefficient summaries (`coefficients`) into one data frame
- Converts `Year` to numeric for proper ordering
- Creates a **grouped bar chart**:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Combine coefficient summaries into one data frame
coef_df <- bind_rows(coefficients, .id = "Year")

# Convert Year to numeric for sorting
coef_df$Year <- as.numeric(coef_df$Year)

    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "black", face = "bold")
  )
```

### Wald's Test

This test helps us understand which **groups of features** (like origin airport, carrier, or departure time) are most useful in predicting flight diversions.

- Groups similar features together (e.g., all destinations or carriers)
- Adds up the scores for each group to measure its overall importance
- Calculates a **p-value** to show how statistically significant each group is:
  - **Smaller p-value = more important**

```{r grouped-wald-clean, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
coefs <- summary(model)$coefficients

wald_df <- data.frame(
  term = rownames(coefs),
  estimate = coefs[, "Estimate"],
  std_error = coefs[, "Std. Error"]
) %>%
  mutate(
    chi2 = (estimate / std_error)^2,
    group = gsub("([A-Z]+$|[0-9]+$)", "", term)
  )

grouped_wald <- wald_df %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(
    chi2 = sum(chi2),
    p_value = pchisq(sum(chi2), df = n(), lower.tail = FALSE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(p_value)

# Save and print the kable output just once
wald_table <- knitr::kable(grouped_wald, caption = "📊 Grouped Wald's Test Summary")
print(wald_table)

### Deleting Cleaned CSV Files (2000–2004)

This code helps clean up temporary files that were created earlier during data processing.

- Makes a list of files to delete (e.g., `2000_Q2C.csv` to `2004_Q2C.csv`)
- Shows the list so you can double-check
- Asks for confirmation before deleting:
  - Type **Y** to delete the files
  - Type **N** to cancel

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Generate list of file names
years <- 2000:2004
csv_files <- paste0(years, "_Q2C.csv")

# Show list of files to delete
cat("Files to be deleted:\n")
print(csv_files)

# Prompt for user confirmation
confirmation <- tolower(readline(prompt = "Do you want to delete the above files? (Y/N): "))

while (confirmation != "y") {
  if (confirmation == "n") {
    cat("Deletion cancelled. Run the chunk again to retry. Thank you.\n")
    break
  } else {
    confirmation <- tolower(readline(prompt = "Invalid input. Please enter 'Y' or 'N': "))
  }
}

# Delete files if confirmed
if (confirmation == "y") {
  for (file in csv_files) {
    if (file.exists(file)) {
      file.remove(file)
      cat("Deleted:", file, "\n")
    } else {
      cat("File not found:", file, "\n")
    }
  }
  cat("Task completed! Cleaned files deleted.\n")
}
```
